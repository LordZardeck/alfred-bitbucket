## Installation

```
npm install --global alfred-bitbucket
```

When installing `alfred-bitbucket`, an `alfred-bitbucket/info.plist` file is created inside your global `node_modules` directory. This file will be used to save your Bitbucket secret and clientId. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Configuration

### Generate Bitbucket consumer

1. Go to your personal **Bitbucket's settings**.
2. Under **Access management**, click on **OAuth**.
3. At the bottom of the page, click the **Add consumer** button.
4. Check **This is a private consumer** to allow client_credentials grant type.
5. Give it a name.
6. In the `Callback URL` field you need to set a URL. This will **not** be used, but it is required in order to get an acces token. Any will do, just make sure it has `http://` or `https://` scheme. You can set it to `https://google.ca` or `https://github.com` or really anything.
6. Make sure to check the following **Read** access.
    - Account
    - Team membership
    - Repositories
    - Pull requests
    - Issues
7. Save it.
8. Your new consumer should appear under the **OAuth consumers** section. Toggle it to see the **Key** and the **Secret**.

### Register environment variables

Since 1.0.3, `info.plist` file is git ignored and copied on installation from an example file. But keep ensuring that you don't push any personnal information.

You can add the required keys either through Alfred `or` directly through the `plist` file.

#### Through Alfred

1. Open Alfred Preferences.
2. Go to the Workflows tab.
3. Select BitBucket.
4. Open the variables panel by clicking the `Configure workflow and variables` button on the right.
5. Fill the values
    - `clientId` : Consumer Key
    - `secret` : Consumer secret
3. Save

#### Through the `plist` file.

1. Open the `info.plist` file.
2. Go down the file to the `variables` key.
3. Fill the following values.
    - `clientId` : Consumer Key
    - `secret` : Consumer secret
4. Save.
